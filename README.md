# C-Firewall (Cloud-Based-Firewall)
C-Firewall is cloud based firewall which provides real world network security and monitoring that can also host on cloud environment.


## Motive 
In this project, firewall is used to protect malicious traffic from incoming connection and restrict connection through it. Cyberattacks are generally committed in cloud when Firewall identifies form different kinds of malicious threats. It can also keep safe distances applications and data servers. Cloud is attached with firewall on network and If incoming traffics redirects into the firewall, then it can filter the traffic or blocks the IP address or mac address. 
  It can filter IP address, Mac Address

 	It protects website which is used in web-hosting
 	Intrusion detection system and prevention system alerts 

## Problems
Approximately, 90% of firms are moderately concerned about public cloud security. As a result, there are vulnerabilities to massive amounts of data theft and data breaches. Cloud security measures are inadequate. Credential theft, along with insider threats and malware injection, has been a recurring issue for organizations.
A malicious attack, A natural disaster, or A service provider data that can be wiped so, all result in data loss on cloud services. For firms who may not have a restoration plan in place, losing important information can be disastrous.
